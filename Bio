Oneiric Stake

I started in 2022 in validating on COSMO with our first chain LUNC and still is. I have been building infrastructure at a slow pace since there is limited resources and have spread to other chains. I do hope to be able to develop dapps and innovative ways to bring validating to the masses but that is a long term goal. I have expanded our chains to few more projects and some testnets. Though due to limited resources I have not been able to expand at the pace I wish to. The following are the existing chains I am validating for.

1] LUNC
2] SENTINEL
3] SOURCE
4] ATOM ONE

My AuM is very low at about below $100K and working hard to get more exposure in the near future and have started building the website. I am a self taught IT admin system integrator and do not have formal education background in computing but has been a passion for me and have built networks system storage and consulted for many studios and architechural firms. Due to many jobs not available now I turn my experiences and skills to now develop in Crypto world and hope to make it big someday.
